            A little about me. I've made my home in Providence, Rhode Island
            with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a
            degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was
            facinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was
            hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own
            specific needs.

            That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I
            learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something
            that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work.
            Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can
            use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean,
            elegant code.
